# 002 - Neovim with LazyVim

## Status
Accepted <2026-02-15 Sun>

## Context

Adding Neovim as a secondary editor alongside Doom Emacs, primarily for scenarios where a lighter-weight editor is useful (quick edits, remote SSH, systems without Emacs). Need a Neovim distribution that provides a good out-of-box experience with minimal configuration.

## Decision
Try out Neovim for a bit, sure, but it is not becoming part of my workflow, at least not for now. Doom emacs works decently on Linux, for what I need. I don't deny that on Windows it might be an entire different world, and I might still end up frustrated...


## Consequences
There is no more neovim in this repository, doom emacs works great for my use cases, at least on Linux.
